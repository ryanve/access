Control content access via a taxonomy that accepts user IDs, roles, or capabilities.

== Description ==

Access is a simple scalable plugin to control user access via the [taxonomy API](http://codex.wordpress.org/Taxonomies) and user [roles/capabilities](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities)/IDs. It creates an Access taxonomy whose terms can be used on any post type to restrict access. Term slugs can match a role, capability, or user ID.
